## Model Training  

### Objectives  

1. **Predicting Subscriber Count**  
   A regression model was trained using features such as Video Views, Video Count, Category, and Year Started to predict the number of subscribers a channel has.  

2. **Classifying Engagement Levels**  
   Channels were categorized into *High* or *Low* engagement classes based on their average views per video and other features.  

### Models Used  

#### Subscriber Count Prediction  
- **Random Forest Regressor**: Achieved a balanced trade-off between accuracy and interpretability.  
- **XGBoost Regressor**: Delivered the best R-squared value among tested models.  
- **Linear Regression**: Provided a baseline for performance comparison.  

#### Engagement Classification  
- **Random Forest Classifier**: Demonstrated high precision and recall for engagement classification.  
- **XGBoost Classifier**: Delivered robust performance with effective handling of feature importance and imbalances in the dataset.  
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**: Offered balanced performance for distinguishing *High* and *Low* engagement classes.  

## Insights  

- **Subscriber Count Prediction**: The XGBoost model outperformed others, achieving a significant R¬≤ value, effectively capturing relationships between channel features and subscriber counts.
